## The Threefold Conjecture

1. We need to get close down to the level of the machine to be in control of it.

2. We need to be in control of the machine to make it collaborate with us effectively.

3. We need to make the machine collaborate with us effectively to create solid high-level code.

## About `okami`

`okami` is a metamodern application development system based on a non-standard dialect of Forth.

The current version is written in ARM (AArch32) assembly language and runs on GNU/Linux.

## Vision

`okami` is supposed to become a fully comprehensible tool for creating real-world applications.

My experience in the world of professional software development is this:
The large frameworks and libraries, the myriads of components and plugins often save as much time as they are going to cost in the end.
Sometimes more, sometimes less.
I got the impression that it evens out eventually.
However, you never know when exactly things will blow up, so they just make development less predictable (and often frustrating).

So are they really necessary?
Are we really in such a mess that a comprehensible system can't be more than a toy?
With `okami`, I am exploring an alternative.

Being a tool for real-world usage means that it won't be maximally elegant.
To get stuff done, compromises are usually required.
So `okami` is not extremely minimal, fully consistent or anything like that.
However, it needs to keep a simple and clear core model or it would be a complete failure.

## Features

* No type inference
* No operator overloading
* No pattern matching
* No type checking (neither static nor dynamic)
* No classes and objects and interfaces and mixins
* No closures
* No local variables
* Only you and the machine having an intelligent conversation to solve problems. :-)

## Requirements

- The ARM CPU it runs on needs to support the division instruction.
  This is the case e.g. on a Raspberry Pi 2, but not on a Raspberry Pi 1.
- The system needs to support little-endian mode.
  Most ARMs nowadays use little-endian anyway, though.
- Setting it up requires an assembler and linker.
  For convenience, `make` and `rlwrap` (for the REPL) are recommended.

No libraries are required, not even `libc`.
The interpreter is a small statically linked binary that uses Linux syscalls directly.

## Usage

Type `make` to assemble and link the interpreter.
You might have to change the name of the assembler and linker to just `as` and `ld`.

To reduce size by stripping debugging symbols, use `make tiny`.
The resulting binary size is currently about 6k.

Run tests with `make test` and start an interactive session with `make repl`.
The latter will require the `rlwrap` utillity.
Alternatively, you can also just do:

    $ ./okami lib/core.ok

This will read `core.ok` and enter the REPL.
(Note that `make repl` also loads some development support words like `backtrace`.)
Running a program can be done by adding more files to process:

    $ ./okami lib/core.ok hello.ok

To not enter the REPL afterwards, a program source can finish with `bye`.

## Tutorial

Basic knowledge of Forth is required for this section.

Code will be compiled if it is enclosed in square brackets, so a basic definition looks like this:

    : 2dup [over over];

There are no immediate words (and no `state`) as in traditional Forth.
That means that compilation directives like control structures must be placed outside of brackets:

    : max
      [2dup >] if [drop] else [nip] then ;

You don't *need* to use square brackets, though.
`okami` uses indirect threaded code, so you could also compile a call manually by first pushing the desired code field address (CFA) onto the stack with `'` (tick) and then writing it into memory with `,` (comma):

    : sqr  ' dup ,  ' * , ;
    : cell+ ' lit , 4 , ' + , ;

Note that square brackets are *not* used to create code blocks (quotations), as in various modern concatenative languages.
They merely denote activation and deactivation of the compiler in the source text.

A second level of nesting brackets is also possible and works similar to `postpone`:

    \ standard Forth code:
    : foo  postpone bar  postpone baz
           quux ; immediate
    : frob 42 foo ;
    
    \ okami equivalent:
    : foo [[bar baz] quux];
    : frob [42] foo ;

The dictionary is placed at the end of the memory area and grows downwards.
It looks like this:

    dp @ points to most recent entry:
    [       2 ] len of name (in cells)
    [   "allo"] entry name, cell 1
    ["t\0\0\0"] cell 2, padded with 0s
    [   ...   ] start addr of definition
    [   ...   ] end addr of definition
    next entry follows immediately:
    [       2 ]
    [   "2dup"] at least one \0 after
    ["\0\0\0\0"] name, plus padding
    [   ...   ]
    [   ...   ]

We store the end of a definition so that we can easiely display a backtrace
(which can be done with the word `backtrace` from `lib/dev.ok`).
So `;` compiles a call to `exit` and stores the current address in the end address of the last definition.

Unfortunatly, the builtin words are currently in a separate dictionary.
So far I failed to create a linker script for GNU ld that makes a unified dictionary work.
This will be easy to fix with our own assembler, though.
One more example of using overcomplex tools not paying off...

In addition to `dp`, there is also `hp` (the `here` pointer), which is used for compiling and by words like `,` (comma).

The content of a definition (usually and preferably) begins with the code field.
So the "start address of the definition" field in the dictionary actually contains the CFA (code field address).

You can use `docol,` and `dodoes,` to make a colon definition or a "does" word.
Since you can create a dictionary entry with `entry`, you could do:

    \ a working definition, although without
    \ proper end given in dictionary:
    entry sqr docol, ' dup , ' * , ' exit ,

A "does" word needs an additional cell after the code field:
The address of the colon definition to execute.

To keep things simpler, we don't use standard `create` ... `does`.
`create` itself works as expected:

    create buffer 256 allot
    : var [create 0,];

However, `does` is combined with the word `with`:

    : const with [,] does [@];
    : array with [cells allot]
            does [swap cells +];

As we have seen, there is no place in anywhere to mark words as hidden.
This means a word can use itself recursively by stating its own name:

    : fact [dup 0=] if [1+] else [dup 1- fact *] then ;

A `begin` `while` `repeat` loop exists that works just like in standard Forth.
Additionally, there is a non-standard `for` `next` loop which pushes a terminating value on the return stack and compares the TOS with it on each iteration:

    : count for [dup . 1+] next ;
    5 10 count
    \ will display: 5 6 7 8 9

You'll have to figure the rest out from the source code for now. :-)
